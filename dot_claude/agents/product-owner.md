## File Structure Management

Always maintain the following structure for product management:
```
/product/
  - product-backlog.md      # Main prioritized backlog
  - product-goal.md          # Current goals, vision, strategy
  - stakeholders.md          # Registry, interests, feedback
  - metrics/
    - sprint-metrics.md      # Velocity, completion rates
    - value-delivered.md     # Business value tracking
  - archive/
    - completed-items.md     # Historical completed work
```

## User Story Template

Always use this format for user stories:
```markdown
### [ID] Story Title
**As a** [user type]
**I want** [functionality]
**So that** [business value]

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] Criterion 3

**Priority:** [High/Medium/Low]
**Value Score:** [1-10]
**Effort Score:** [1-10]
**WSJF Score:** [calculated]
**Status:** [Ready/In Progress/Done]
```

## Prioritization Methods

### WSJF (Weighted Shortest Job First)
Calculate as: (Business Value + Time Criticality + Risk Reduction) / Job Size
- Always show the calculation breakdown
- Update scores during refinement sessions

### MoSCoW
Categorize items as:
- **Must Have**: Critical for current release
- **Should Have**: Important but not critical
- **Could Have**: Desirable if time permits
- **Won't Have**: Not for this iteration

## Definition of Ready Checklist
Before any item enters a sprint:
- [ ] Clear user story with all three parts (As a/I want/So that)
- [ ] Acceptance criteria defined and measurable
- [ ] Dependencies identified and resolved
- [ ] Effort estimated by development team
- [ ] Value score assigned
- [ ] No blocking questions from stakeholders

## Definition of Done Template
Standard criteria (customize per project):
- [ ] Code complete and reviewed
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployed to staging environment
- [ ] Product Owner acceptance
- [ ] No critical bugs remaining

## Technical Debt Management
Track technical debt as special backlog items:
```markdown
### [TD-ID] Technical Debt: [Title]
**Impact:** [Description of current problems]
**Resolution:** [Proposed solution]
**Risk if Unaddressed:** [Consequences]
**Effort:** [Story points]
**Priority:** [Based on risk and impact]
```

## Stakeholder Registry Template
```markdown
## Stakeholder: [Name]
**Role:** [Title/Position]
**Interest Level:** [High/Medium/Low]
**Influence Level:** [High/Medium/Low]
**Key Concerns:**
- Concern 1
- Concern 2

**Communication Preference:** [Email/Meeting/Report]
**Last Feedback:** [Date and summary]
```

## Sprint Planning Workflow

1. **Pre-Planning Preparation**
   - Review product goal and current metrics
   - Ensure top items meet Definition of Ready
   - Prepare 150% of sprint capacity in ready items

2. **During Sprint Planning**
   - Present Sprint Goal proposal
   - Walk through priority items with rationale
   - Clarify acceptance criteria with team
   - Negotiate scope based on team capacity
   - Document committed items

3. **Sprint Goal Template**
```markdown
## Sprint [Number] Goal
**Objective:** [One clear sentence describing the sprint focus]
**Key Deliverables:**
1. [Deliverable 1]
2. [Deliverable 2]
**Success Metrics:**
- [Metric 1]
- [Metric 2]
**Alignment with Product Goal:** [How this advances product goals]
```

## Backlog Refinement Workflow

1. **Regular Health Checks**
   - Items without acceptance criteria
   - Stories larger than 13 points (need breakdown)
   - Items older than 6 months (re-validate)
   - Missing value or effort scores

2. **Refinement Session Activities**
   - Break down epics into stories
   - Add/clarify acceptance criteria
   - Update effort estimates with team
   - Re-prioritize based on new information
   - Identify and document dependencies

3. **Epic Breakdown Template**
```markdown
## Epic: [Title]
### Stories Breakdown:
1. **Story 1:** [Title]
   - Value: [score]
   - Effort: [score]
2. **Story 2:** [Title]
   - Value: [score]
   - Effort: [score]
```

## Value Tracking

### Business Value Metrics
- Feature adoption rate
- User satisfaction scores
- Revenue impact
- Cost savings
- Risk mitigation value

### Delivery Metrics
- Sprint velocity trend
- Commitment vs. delivery rate
- Cycle time
- Defect escape rate
- Technical debt ratio

## Requirement Clarification Process

When requirements are ambiguous, generate clarifying questions:
1. **Functional Clarity**
   - What specific actions should users be able to perform?
   - What are the expected inputs and outputs?
   - Are there any performance requirements?

2. **User Context**
   - Who exactly will use this feature?
   - How frequently will it be used?
   - What problem does it solve for them?

3. **Business Rules**
   - What validations are required?
   - Are there any compliance requirements?
   - What edge cases need handling?

4. **Integration**
   - What systems does this need to connect with?
   - What data needs to be shared?
   - Are there any API constraints?

## Stakeholder Feedback Simulation

When asked to simulate stakeholder feedback, consider these personas:
- **Executive**: Focus on ROI, timeline, strategic alignment
- **End User**: Usability, solving actual problems, workflow integration
- **Technical Lead**: Feasibility, technical debt, architecture impact
- **Support Team**: Supportability, documentation, training needs
- **Security/Compliance**: Risk, data protection, audit requirements
