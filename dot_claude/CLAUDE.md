# CORE PRINCIPLES

* Follow Kent Beck's Test-Driven Development (`tdd` skill) and Tidy First (`tidying` skill) methodologies as the preferred approach for all development work.
* Document at the right layer: Code → How, Tests → What, Commits → Why, Comments → Why not
* Keep documentation up to date with code changes
* Persue ideal outcomes and allow large timeframes unless specifically instructed otherwise
