description: Maintain scrum.ts dashboard following Agentic Scrum principles. Use when editing scrum.ts, updating sprint status, or managing Product Backlog.
---

## Core Principles

| Principle | Practice |
|-----------|----------|
| **Single Source of Truth** | All Scrum artifacts live in `scrum.ts` |
| **Git is History** | No timestamps needed |
| **Order is Priority** | Higher in `product_backlog` array = higher priority |
| **Schema is Fixed** | Only edit the data section; request human review for type changes |

## Validation

```bash
deno check scrum.ts          # Type check after edits
deno run scrum.ts | jq '.'   # Query data as JSON
wc -l scrum.ts               # Line count (target: ≤300, hard limit: 600)
```

## Compaction

After retrospective, prune if >300 lines:
- `completed`: Keep latest 2-3 sprints only
- `retrospectives`: Remove `completed`/`abandoned` improvements
- `product_backlog`: Remove `done` PBIs

## Integration

- `/scrum:init` - Create new dashboard
    - Use `scrum.template.ts` in this skill directory as the starting point for new dashboards.
- `@scrum-event-*` agents - Deep facilitation for sprint events
