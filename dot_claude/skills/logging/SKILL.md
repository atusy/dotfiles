# INSTRUCTIONS

Apply Dave Cheney's logging philosophy: simplify ruthlessly, handle errors properly, and log only what matters.

## Core Principles

1. **Only Two Log Levels Matter**
   - **Info**: For operators/users—things they need to know during normal operation
   - **Debug**: For developers—controlled per-package during development

2. **Eliminate Unnecessary Levels**
   | Level | Verdict | Reason |
   |-------|---------|--------|
   | Warning | Remove | "Nobody reads warnings"—either it's an error or info |
   | Fatal | Avoid | Bypasses `defer`, prevents cleanup. Let errors bubble to `main()` |
   | Error | Rethink | If handled, it's info. If not handled, return it to caller |

3. **The Golden Rule of Error Logging**
   > "You should either handle the error, or pass it back to the caller."

   - **Don't** log an error AND return it (causes duplicate logs up the stack)
   - **Don't** log errors in library code (caller decides what to do)
   - **Do** let errors bubble up to where they can be meaningfully handled

4. **Terminal Error Handlers: When Error Level IS Appropriate**

   At the boundary where errors become **user-facing unexpected failures** (e.g., 5xx responses), error-level logging is correct:

   - The error chain ends here—no caller to return to
   - The user receives a generic message (for security/UX)
   - Operators need the full error details for debugging

   ```go
   // At HTTP handler boundary - error level is appropriate
   if err != nil {
       log.Error("unexpected failure",
           "error", err,
           "request_id", requestID,
       )
       http.Error(w, "Internal Server Error", http.StatusInternalServerError)
       return
   }
   ```

   **This is NOT the same as logging mid-stack**—this is the terminal handler where errors are finally consumed, not propagated.

## Review Checklist

When reviewing or writing logging code:

- [ ] Is this log statement for users (info) or developers (debug)?
- [ ] Am I logging an error AND returning it? (Remove the log)
- [ ] Is this a terminal handler (5xx boundary)? (Error level is appropriate here)
- [ ] Is this a warning? (Convert to info or error, or remove)
- [ ] Is this `Fatal`/`panic` in library code? (Return error instead)
- [ ] Does this log message help the operator understand system state?

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

```go
// BAD: Log and return (duplicate logs)
if err != nil {
    log.Error("failed to connect", err)
    return err
}

// GOOD: Just return (let caller decide)
if err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("connect: %w", err)
}

// BAD: Warning that nobody will act on
log.Warn("connection pool running low")

// GOOD: Either info (if expected) or error (if action needed)
log.Info("connection pool at 80% capacity")
```

## Structured Logging

When logging is appropriate, prefer structured formats:

```go
// Prefer structured fields over string interpolation
log.Info("request completed",
    "method", r.Method,
    "path", r.URL.Path,
    "duration", time.Since(start),
)
```
