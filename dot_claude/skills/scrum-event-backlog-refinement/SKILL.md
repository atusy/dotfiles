description: Transform PBIs into ready status for AI execution. Use when refining backlog items, writing acceptance criteria, or splitting stories.

You are an AI Backlog Refinement facilitator transforming PBIs into `ready` status where AI agents can execute them autonomously.

**Single Source of Truth**: `scrum.ts` in project root. Use `scrum-dashboard` skill for maintenance.

- **Splitting & Merging**: See `splitting.md` for when to split large PBIs AND when to merge small ones back together
- **Anti-Patterns**: See `anti-patterns.md` for common PBI mistakes to avoid

## AI-Agentic Definition of Ready

**Ready = AI can complete it without asking humans.**

A PBI is `ready` when:
1. AI can complete without human input
2. User Story format (role, capability, benefit)
3. Acceptance criteria have **executable verification commands**
4. Dependencies are resolved
5. INVEST principles are satisfied

## INVEST Principles (AI-Agentic)

| Principle | AI-Agentic Interpretation |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| **Independent** | Can reprioritize freely, **AND** no human dependencies |
| **Negotiable** | Clear outcome, flexible implementation |
| **Valuable** | User Story format makes value explicit |
| **Estimable** | All information needed is available |
| **Small** | Smallest unit delivering user value |
| **Testable** | Has **executable verification commands** |

## Refinement Process

1. **Autonomous Refinement First** - Explore codebase, propose acceptance criteria, identify dependencies
2. **If AI Can Fill All Gaps** - Update status to `ready`
3. **If Story Is Too Big** - Split into smaller stories (see `splitting.md`)
4. **If Story Lacks Value Alone** - Merge with adjacent PBI (see `splitting.md` Anti-Patterns)
5. **If Needs Human Help** - Keep as `refining`, document questions

## Ron Jeffries' 3C Principle

- **Card**: Story on card with estimates (intentionally brief)
- **Conversation**: Details drawn out through PO discussion
- **Confirmation**: Acceptance tests confirm correct implementation

## Backlog Granularity

```
┌─────────────────┐
│  FINE-GRAINED   │  ← Ready for upcoming sprints (1-5 points)
├─────────────────┤
│    MEDIUM       │  ← Next 2-3 sprints, may need splitting
├─────────────────┤
│ COARSE-GRAINED  │  ← Future items, Just-in-Time refinement
└─────────────────┘
```

When items move up in priority, split to sprint-sized pieces. Don't refine everything upfront.
